# Klaudia Janecka

## Welcome to my personal repository where I showcase my programming projects, developed during my studies in computer science and self-development initiatives.

In this repository, you will find a collection of projects developed using various technologies, including Java, .NET, JavaScript, and more. Each project has been carefully curated to showcase my skills and knowledge in these different programming languages and frameworks.

Whether you are looking for a simple command-line program or a complex web application, you will find it all here in this repository. Additionally, some project includes a detailed README file that provides information on how to run the code and what the project does.

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my skills, so this repository will continue to be updated with new projects as I continue to learn and grow as a developer.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my repository, and feel free to reach out to me with any questions or feedback!
